                    “Little Red Riding Hood was my first love. I felt that if I could have married Little Red
                    Riding Hood, I should have known perfect bliss.” When Charles Dickens made this
                    confession, he was living in an age that knew only the innocent child in stories collected
                    by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. In those folkloric treatments, a villainous
                    predator squares off against a sweet, trusting child and earns a bad name for himself
                    as a ruthless, gluttonous beast. Dickens's first love had not yet grown up to become Red
                    Hot Riding Hood, Little Red Running Shorts, Little Red Riding Crop, or any number of
                    other seductive sirens, attractive fashionistas, and unyielding avengers who face down
                    the horrors of beasts in the forest.

                    We often think of “Little Red Riding Hood” as a story with a whiff of the archaic, but
                    it is in fact alive and present in our own culture with near manic expressive intensity. So
                    ubiquitous is the tale that it sometimes disappears from sight precisely because it is so
                    familiar. The girl in red appears in story and song, on screen and on the written page, on
                    the runway as well as on stage. A source of adult entertainment, she is also very much
                    at home in the nursery, telling us not only about encounters between predator and prey
                    but also about human interactions that foreground innocence and seduction. Hers is a
                    story about appetite in all shadings of the term, from primal hunger to sexual desire,
                    both tainted by the threat of desire turning dark and deadly—desire so rapacious that it
                    feeds on human life. We are as much in the realm of myth as of fairy tale, with stories
                    that provide a platform for staging the consequences of desires, sinister and benign, in
                    their most vivid and extreme form.

                    “Little Red Riding Hood” most likely emerged as part of a storytelling culture that took
                    up the theme of predatory animals roaming the countryside in search of food. As Barbara
                    Ehrenreich tells us, “human storytelling ... grew out of encounters with real animal
                    predators and served as a means of fear management as well as a means to ready the
                    group for future encounters.” The earliest versions of “Little Red Riding Hood” featured.
